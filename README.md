# ML & NLP Conference Deadlines 

 **single-file live dashboard** for tracking important deadlines — including academic conference dates  
(e.g. ML, NLP, Computer Vision) and recurring submission cycles like **ACL Rolling Review (ARR)**.  
It’s easy to personalize, lightweight, and styled in a minimal **black-theme layout**.


## Feature

| Feature | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Live countdown** | Days : Hours : Minutes : Seconds to each *submission* deadline (updates every second). |
| **Urgency bar** | Green ›14 d • Yellow 7-14 d • Orange 2-6 d • **Red <48 h** (8 px stripe at row’s left). |
| **Past-date dimming** | When a deadline passes the date turns muted gray/italic (`.dim-text`). |
| **Flags** | Country flag appended to each conference name (table 1 only). |
| **Estonian time badge** | Fixed example: “Times shown in Estonian time (Europe/Tallinn, UTC +03)”. Change the IANA zone in one line. |
| **Glitch title** | Flickering CRT effect provided by **`glitch_H2.js`**. Remove the `<script>` tag if you want a static title. |
| **Zero dependencies** | Pure HTML + CSS + vanilla JS – open the file locally, no build or server. |
